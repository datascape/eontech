<h1>Hyperfast Delivery</h1>

<p>We asked ourselves how cities would change in 50 years and came up with the concept of a "Technology Neighborhood" &ndash; a location close to warehouses and in-vehicle storage where any product requested could be fabricated and delivered within one to ten minutes through a combination of 3D printing, hypertube transit and drone delivery for the last mile.</p>

<p>Jump Technology combines the fast tube transit of Elon Musk’s HyperTube with wing-sitter launch vehicles like Google’s Project Wing. They all come together in one amazing delivery system, where public and private wings carry people to the location they desire. They journey most of the way in a hypertube than when the wing gets to the exit closest to the intended location it flies the remaining distances and lowers down its cargo capsule so residents can avoid rotating propellers.</p>

<h2>Community Impact</h2>

<p>Google’s original Project Wing drones were designed to deliver supplies for the 911 system, like defibrillators. They soon realized delivering normal everyday things was needed, but the size of the first Project Wing vehicle limited what they could deliver. Their problems will be solved by a larger vehicle, accelerated by railgun propulsion over safe flyways where they’ve buried power line and fiber optics.</p>

<p>Hyperfast delivery won’t just change people’s lives by delivering packages, pizza, eyes of newt, and whatever else you wanted shipped to your house quickly. With storage increasingly occurring outside the home, residents will be able to live separately from clutter, and they’ll be able to share their items with others much easier, earning revenue or favor points.</p>

<h2>National Impact</h2>

<p>While the HyperWing delivery vehicle might not be yours, the Big Egg capsules will typically be owned by individuals. The Big Egg can act as a place to study, watch movies and will provide a much faster bus for kids going to school. The wing you are in will deliver the gyro with you in it to your location and drop you down like you're a package. The egg will slow your fall so when you hit the ground it is a tiny little tap. The Big Egg gyro is great for doing research because if you go inside it’s one big monitor for you to interact with.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's Hyperloop will start to connect major cities and seaports around the country. With HyperWing transit completing the final jump of the Hyperloop, seaports like Savanna, Georgia will be able to deliver products 100’s of times faster than traditional delivery.</p>






<h2>Global Impact</h2>

<p>The combination of Hyperloop tubes with HyperWing flight and automated delivery will bring families together more often and open up new markets that could not be easily reached by one technology alone. The fuel efficiency of traveling in a near-vacuum with minimum friction, solar power panels on the tubes, and direct delivery without sitting idle in traffic will make a significant impact on reducing vehicle carbon emissions.</p>
